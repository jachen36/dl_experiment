# TODO list


* create a notebook on how I split the data and export as a csv
    * folder name, file name, train/val 
    * maybe not export it as a csv but remake the whole folder dir by adding a val folder and transfer the image over
* create a notebook that summarize the result 
* need a script at the end of the notebook that rerun another notebook and save
* a better way to display the trend line
* add a section that looks at images that were very confident but got wrong
